<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

## nearestPoint

Takes a reference [point](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2) and a FeatureCollection of Features
with Point geometries and returns the
point from the FeatureCollection closest to the reference. This calculation
is geodesic.

**Parameters**

-   `targetPoint` **[Coord](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.1)** the reference point
-   `points` **[FeatureCollection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3)&lt;[Point](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2)>** against input point set

**Examples**

```javascript
var targetPoint = turf.point([28.965797, 41.010086], {"marker-color": "#0F0"});
var points = turf.featureCollection([
    turf.point([28.973865, 41.011122]),
    turf.point([28.948459, 41.024204]),
    turf.point([28.938674, 41.013324])
]);

var nearest = turf.nearestPoint(targetPoint, points);

//addToMap
var addToMap = [targetPoint, points, nearest];
nearest.properties['marker-color'] = '#F00';
```

Returns **[Feature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2)&lt;[Point](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2)>** the closest point in the set to the reference point
