A short explanation of the code, plus a reference to the github repository and a link to the tutorial on the OS Data Hub Tutorials page. 

## Plan

A scrollstory with photos, a map, and possibly a video.

0. The Approach. driving from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis, the route taken (ORS or Mapbox directions API?), photos along the way. 
- Full screen map with route in (colour) drawing along. Explanation of the thirst for adventure, glimpses of the highlands, maybe the horses.
- Arrive in Fort William, map fade to black, 3D model scroll in from the bottom.
1. The Mountain. The area around Ben Nevis, the history, the geology. 3D model from Charley, perhaps flythrough video / gif.
- Scroll in, lock on screen, a bit of info about the mountain, history, geology. Key Facts. 
- 3D model fade to black.
2. The Ascent. Climbing up into the clouds, colder and colder.
- Map fade back in, pink dot at end of car journey. 
- Scrolling causes dot to draw on the map. 
- Text and photos scrolling by over the map's left-most part.
3. The Summit. Socked in, frigid, happy. Thank you to whoever built the metal hut.
- Zoom in on summit, map fades to black. 
- Photos of the summit scroll in, with text. 
4. The Way Down. Quad burning, knee straining descent out of the clouds and back down to sea level.
- Title, then photos of descent.
5. Done.
