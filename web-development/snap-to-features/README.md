# Snap to features tutorial

What: Deriving new features/datasets from OS’ detailed and accurate MasterMap geometries by either copying/merging/snapping-to.
 
This is something that many across the Public Sector need to do as a requirement.
It is also useful in the Land & Prop sector, Environmental sector and I’m sure many others.
 
This is possible in GIS clients like QGIS and Cadcorp and there will be many software providers offering this functionality across Gov.
 
Idea: Based on Tim’s awesome demo – we can show how people can take this functionality from the desktop and do it online.
 
Render OS Vector Tile API
Zoom in so you get the full detail of MasterMap
Ability to click and select features and for these to be merged if touching
Highlight the new features on the map
Download the GeoJSON – include any useful attribution
 
Nice to haves
Select/restrict which types of features are selectable e.g. only buildings, only roads, buildings & manmade & multi surface
Add custom attributes
Download different formats (possibly translate to BNG?)
Customise/edit the shapes once selected e.g. drag nodes around, add new shapes and merge in etc.
