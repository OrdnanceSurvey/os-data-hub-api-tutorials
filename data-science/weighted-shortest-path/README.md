# Title

Maps are especially useful as navigational aids - with relevant, accurate and complete location data, people can find the most efficient route from A to B. 

In this tutorial, we will create a graph of the road network in an area, to calculate the shortest path between points. We will incorporate a weighting function, so users can alter their preferred path based on the attributes of road segments en route. For example, a cyclist might want to stick to very small roads, so larger roads will have a higher weight - or commercial trucking operators might want to avoid steep hills, or only travel on large roads.

## Tools and APIs

We'll use the OS Features API to fetch relevant OS data, as well as the geopandas and networkx Python libraries.
